# Project Robin

## Description
Project Robin is a project based on the development of a compiler for a robot that will move in a 10x10 grid. The robot uses a special grammar that allows it to follow a series of instructions, these instructions include movements ('MOV') and turns ('TURN') with angles of 90째, 180째, 270째, and 360째. Additionally, error handling has been incorporated to return an illegal instruction message when the movement leads the robot outside the boundaries of the matrix.
