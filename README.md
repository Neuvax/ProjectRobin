# Project Robin

### Description
Project Robin is a project based on the development of a compiler for a robot that will move in a 10x10 grid. The robot uses a special grammar that allows it to follow a series of instructions, these instructions include movements ('MOV') and turns ('TURN') with angles of 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°. Additionally, error handling has been incorporated to return an illegal instruction message when the movement leads the robot outside the boundaries of the grid.

### Language
The language used by the robot must be polite and must follow the grammar provided.
Here are some examples of valid sentences:

| Inputs | Instruction|
| :--- | :--- |
| Robot please move 2 steps  | Content Cell  |
| Robot please move 2 steps | Content Cell  |
| Robot kindly rotate 270 degrees to the left | Content Cell  |
| Robot kindly move 3 steps | Content Cell  |
| Robot please turn 90 degrees to the left then move 5 units to the front | Content Cell  |
