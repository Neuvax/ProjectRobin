# Project Robin

## Description
Project Robin is a project based on the development of a compiler for a robot that will move in a 10x10 grid. The robot uses a special grammar that allows it to follow a series of instructions, these instructions include movements ('MOV') and turns ('TURN') with angles of 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°. Additionally, error handling has been incorporated to return an illegal instruction message when the movement leads the robot outside the boundaries of the grid.
