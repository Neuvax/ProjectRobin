## Testing
In order to test our robot, you need to be located in the `cpu.py` file found in the CPU folder and run the command `python3 cpu.py` <br>
When executing the command, an `.asm` file is also created indicating whether the sentences that were entered are valid or not.
If valid, a **PASS** will appear, otherwise the program will stop.<br>
On the other hand, in the **Test** folder there is a file called `test.py`, which does the unit test of the robot.py code (which would be the robot's cpu) to check that the turns are being performed correctly.
