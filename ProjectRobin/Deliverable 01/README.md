# Robot Movement Automaton in a 2D Matrix

This project involves a deterministic automaton that simulates the movement logic of a robot in a 2D matrix of 10 blocks. The automaton is implemented in Python and uses a set of instructions including movements ('MOV') and turns ('TURN') with angles of 90째, 180째, 270째, and 360째. Additionally, error handling has been incorporated to return an illegal instruction message when the movement leads the robot outside the boundaries of the matrix.

The automaton is represented using a directed graph using the Graphviz library, allowing for a clear visualization of the different states and transitions between them. Furthermore, a method is included to execute a sequence of instructions and determine if they have been successfully completed or if there are missing instructions.

This project provides a basic implementation of the automaton and can be customized and expanded upon to meet specific needs. It is useful for understanding automaton concepts and movement logic in the context of a robot in a 2D matrix.
